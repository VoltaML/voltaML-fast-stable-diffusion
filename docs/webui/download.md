# Download

This page will teach you how to download models with the power of HuggingFaceðŸ¤—.

## Upsides

- Models can be easily searched for and downloaded without having to copy over huge model files to and from Docker
- HuggingFace uses modular structure, so some components of the model can be swapped out for other ones

## Drawbacks

- Only models from HuggingFace are supported (no CivitAI yet)

## How to use

Select something from the curated models (will be updated soon) and click the `Download` button.

**OR**

1. Search for the model you want to download on the [HuggingFace model hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
2. Copy the model name (e.g. `andite/anything-v4.0`, not the URL)
3. Paste the model name into the `Model name` input
4. Click `Download` button
5. See the terminal output for progress feedback
