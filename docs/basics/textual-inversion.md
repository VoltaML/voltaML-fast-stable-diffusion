# Textual Inversion

Textual Inversion (Embedding) is a way to define new keywords in a model without modifying the model itself. With this technology, you can inject new objects and styles without training a full model from scratch.

## Downloading

Textual Inversion is available to download from [Civit.ai](https://civit.ai/). You can download them from there and then upload them to Volta via the Model Manager:
