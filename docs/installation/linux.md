## Installation

### 1. Create a new folder for the project

You can do this in the terminal (`mkdir volta`) or visually with Dolphin or Nautilus. Name doesn't matter, so go with something that you like as you will hopefully be using VoltaML for a long time 😄.

### 2. Download the VoltaML Manager executable

Download the VoltaML Manager executable from the [VoltaML Manager releases page](https://github.com/VoltaML/voltaML-fast-stable-diffusion/releases)

Select the latest release and download `voltaml-manger`:
